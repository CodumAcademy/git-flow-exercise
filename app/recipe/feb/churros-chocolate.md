## Ingredients

- 125 g self-raising flour
- 125 g plain flour
- 1 pinch salt
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 400 ml boiling water
- 200 g dark chocolate
- 80 g caster sugar
- 100 ml double cream
- 50 ml hot water
- 1 tsp instant coffee
- 1 mug caster sugar for coating churros

# Instructions

1. Preheat fryer to 170°C. Measure all of the chocolate sauce ingredients into a saucepan and heat very slowly until melted and smooth…. over a pan or in a microwave. Keep warm whilst making the churros.
2. Sieve both flours and salt into a bowl and make a well in the centre. Whisk the olive oil and boiling water together and slowly pour into the well, beating furiously so that there are no lumps but you have a thick paste.
3. Scoop all of the batter into a piping bag with a star nozzle and then pipe strips carefully into the hot oil to fry. Keep the nozzle close to the oil and snip off the batter with a pair of scissors when they are long enough.
4. Squeeze enough into the pan to make a few at a time and fry them for 3 minutes until golden brown. Lift them out of the oil and drain on paper towels before rolling in the sugar whilst still hot.
5. Serve in a cone, drizzled with the chocolate sauce. Makes 12.
